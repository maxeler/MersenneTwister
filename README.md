=============================
Mersenne Twister PRNG App
=============================

This Application enables you to generate random numbers with arbitrary length following a uniform distribution using Maxeler DFEs


Introduction
------------

This APP showcases how Mersenne Twisters can be implemented using MaxJ and using the MaxPower library provided by Maxeler.
More details can be found in the DOCS folder.


Features
--------

* Low hardware costs
* Bit width of random number can be freely chosen. In terms of resource usage two or more smaller Mersenne Twisters instead of one big one will perform better as the bit width rises.
* Pearson Chi Squared test passed at a 99% confidence level
